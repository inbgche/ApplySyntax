This is ApplySyntax.sublime-settings sample file for unity3d. 

As you may know ST3 can be used as default IDE for Unity3D. 

But, Every time you open C# file from unityIDE, ST3 detect the file as default C# file, not Unity3D C# file. 

So ApplySyntax is solution for the problem. 

I put the sample file. You have to rename it(remove post fix '.unity3d'), and put the setting file in the folder, 
"/Users/YourLoginName/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User". 

Enjoy!
